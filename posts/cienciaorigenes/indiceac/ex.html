<h2 class="c">Claim CB601.4:</h2>
In one of Bernard Kettlewell's peppered moth studies, his moth recapture
rate increased greatly beginning on July 1.  July 1 was also the date on
which E. B. Ford sent Kettlewell a letter commiserating with him for the
low recapture rates.  This suggests that Kettlewell cheated to increase
his recapture rates.

<h2>Response:</h2>
<ol>
<li> Kettlewell would not have received Ford's letter before the increase in
   his recapture rate had already begun.  The collection of July 1 was
   completed by the early morning.  Since Ford's letter would have arrived
   after, it could not have been a factor.
<br /><br /></li><li> Kettlewell recaptured more moths after July 1 because he was releasing
   more moths then.  The number of moths he collected is not significantly
   different from the collections one would expect on the basis of the
   number of moths released in the two prior days (Young 2004).  He
   probably released more moths because the moths he was rearing reached
   adulthood then.
<br /><br /></li><li> Much of the remaining variation in recapture rate might be explained by
   moonlight.  The low recapture rates occurred when the moon was full,
   and for many species of moths, a full moon reduces the numbers caught
   in light traps.
<br /><br /></li><li> Kettlewell's conclusions were based not only on his recapture
   experiment but also on three other investigations.  The same
   conclusions were found by many other experiments on peppered and other
   moths by other researchers (Grant 1999).
