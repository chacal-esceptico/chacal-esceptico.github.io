<h2 class="c">Claim CB930.4:</h2>
Pterodactyls, extinct flying reptiles, supposedly existed around one
hundred million years ago.  According to an article in <i>The Illustrated
London News</i> of February 9, 1856, page 166, workmen discovered a living
pterodactyl.  In the winter of 1856, they were working on a railway tunnel
between St. Dizey and the Nancy lines, and they had broken and removed a
boulder of Jurassic limestone, when the creature stumbled out of the
tunnel toward them.  It fluttered its wings, croaked, and collapsed dead
at their feet.  It had a wingspan of ten feet seven inches, four legs with
talons for feet, legs joined by a membrane like a bat, a mouth filled with
sharp teeth, and black, leathery, oily skin.  An exact mold of the
creature's body was found in the limestone from which the creature was
released.

<h2>Response:</h2>
<ol>
<li> The story is true to the extent that the discovery of a pterodactyl
   was reported in the 1856 newspaper.
<br /><br
 />
   At the time, there was a great Franco-Prussian rivalry, and the
   Solnhofen Limestone from Bavaria (from which <i>Archaeopteryx</i> would
   later be discovered) was producing many fabulous fossils which were
   loudly trumpeted by German paleontologists.  When a tunnel was being
   built in France through limestone the same age as the Solnhofen
   Limestone, French "gentlemen geologists" took the opportunity to
   trumpet a story of their own.  In the original report, the pterodactyl
   crumbled to dust, conveniently leaving no evidence.
<br /><br
 />
   The newspaper account identified the pterodactyl as <i>Pterodactylus
   anas</i>.  <i>Pterodactylus</i> is a genus of robin-sized pterosaurs, none
 with
   a wingspan even approaching ten feet.  "<i>Anas</i>" is Latin for "duck,"
   which is "canard" in French, which is an English word for a hoax.
<br /><br /></li><li> The story is ridiculous on its face and really deserves no more
   response than ridicule.  When did creationists decide that gullibility
   is a virtue?
